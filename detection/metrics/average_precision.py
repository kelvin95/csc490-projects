def compute_precision_recall_curve(

) -> PRCurve:
    """Compute a precision/recall curve over a batch of evaluation frames.

    The PR curve plots the trade-off between precision and recall when sweeping
    across different score thresholds for your detections. To compute precision
    and recall for a score threshold s_i, consider the set of detections with
    scores greater than or equal to s_i. A detection is a true positive if it
    matches a ground truth label; it is a false positive if it does not.

    With this, we define precision = TP / (TP + FP) and recall = TP / (TP + FN),
    where TP is the number of true positive detections, FP is the number of false
    positive detections, and FN is the number of false negative labels (i.e. the
    number of ground truth labels that did not match any detections). By varying
    the score threshold s_i over all detection scores, we have the PR curve.

    What does it mean for a detection to match a ground truth label? In this assignment, we use
    the following definition: A detection matches a ground truth label if: (1) the Euclidean
    distance between their centers is at most `threshold`; and (2) no higher scoring detection
    satisfies condition (1) with respect to the same label.

    Args:
        frames: A batch of evaluation frames, each containing a detection/label pair.
        threshold: Two bounding boxes match if their bird's eye view
            center-to-center distance is strictly less than `threshold`.

    Returns:
        A precision/recall curve.
